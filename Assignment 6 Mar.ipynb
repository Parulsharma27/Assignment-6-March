    "Descriptive Statistics:\n",
    "Descriptive statistics is concerned with describing and summarizing data. It involves the calculation of measures such as the mean, median, mode, standard deviation, and range. Descriptive statistics is used to understand the characteristics of a dataset and to summarize the data in a meaningful way.\n",

    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose a researcher collects data on the heights of students in a school. The researcher can use descriptive statistics to calculate the average height of the students, the range of heights, and the standard deviation of the heights.\n",

    "Inferential Statistics:\n",
    "Inferential statistics is concerned with making inferences and predictions about a population based on a sample of data. It involves the use of probability theory to make estimates and draw conclusions about the population. Inferential statistics is used when it is not possible to collect data from the entire population, and instead, a representative sample is collected.\n",

    "Example:\n",
